## About this project:-

- This project is a room based app in which host can CREATE the room. For which he will have to Authenticate with their Spotify account.
- Each room is UNIQUELY identified by its room code - A 6 character UNIQUE CODE.
- Other users can join the room by Room Code after Authenticating from their Spotify account.
- If host leaves room, Room is destroyed.
- Host can update how many votes required to skip the song.
- Host has PLAYBACK CONTROLS (PLAY/PAUSE/SKIP) for the room. However he must have premium spotify account to do this as per Spotify documentation.
- Every other users can see the song whhich is being played (ALBUM COVER, TITLE, ARTIST, PROGRESS)

# NOTE:-

    - Don't foregt to create your own spotify developer account and replace credentials in ./spotify/credentials.py file.

    - For redirect URI put [{YOUR_LOCAL_HOST_URL} or {YOUR_PRODUCTION_APP_URL}]/spotify/redirect this should be also added into your created app in spotify dhashboard in your app settings.

    - Spotify API doesn't allow playback controls (PLAY/PAUSE/SKIP/SEEK) from API endpoint unless that user has premium account. So keep that in mind while runnig the application.
